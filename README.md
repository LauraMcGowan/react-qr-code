# Laura's QR Code

This package was built using react, and TypeScript

##

Used ‘npm I vite’ (similar to create react app)
https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite
Installed npm install qrcode.react
(A React component to generate QR codes for rendering to the DOM)

##

'npm run dev` to run on localhost:3000
